Introduction:

The Project to be developed is a Command Line Based Music Player completely written in C++. It should play, pause and shuffle all music files in a specific directory and all it’s interface should be in C++ command line terminal. We have divided the code into three files namely files.h , define.h , and main.cpp so as to improve code readability and debugging.

Objective:

The main objective is to play any non variable bit rate mp3 file using mciSendStrings() function defined in C++ windows.h header file.

Instructions

    To run this code in visual studio code you have to add linker library -lwinmm here Linker It's a Windows Multimedia Library

    If you are using code blocks or Visual Studio IDE you can directly add path of lwinmm in linker library options.

    If you want to add more songs you can add it in songs folder after converting mp3 files to mono bitrate.

Working Environment:

    Visual Studio Code - 1.56.2
    C++ standard 17
    Operating System – Windows 10 64 Bit
    C++ Compiler – MinGW gcc x64
